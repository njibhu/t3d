# Tyria 3D Library

Tyria 3D Library is an open source javascript library aimed at accessing and interpreting data from Guild Wars 2 .dat files.

## It's not the original ?

This version is a fork of RequestTimeout408/Tyria3DLibrary since the original library is not maintained anymore.

## Installation

### Requirements 
* npm
* gulp-cli

### Usage

``npm install``

``gulp``

## Examples
There are few example applications in the examples folder. I sugest looking at the source of index.html in examples/ModelRenderer first!

## Documentation
The documentation of the current release is available in the documentation folder, also don't hesitate to go through the code itself.

## Contact

If you have any questions, feedback or suggestions feel free to create a new issue here on github !

### Building documentation
This project uses jsdoc3 for javadoc-ish documentation creation.

Usage:

``npm -g install jsdoc``

``jsdoc -c jsdoc.conf.json``
