# Tyria 3D Library

Tyria 3D Library is an open source javascript library aimed at accessing and interpreting data from Guild Wars 2 .dat files.

## It's not the original ?

This version is a fork of RequestTimeout408/Tyria3DLibrary since the original library is not maintained anymore.

## Installation

### Requirements

- npm
- gulp-cli

### Usage

`npm install`

`npx gulp`

## Examples

There are few example applications in the examples folder. I sugest looking at the source of index.html in examples/ModelRenderer first!

## Documentation

The documentation of the current release is available in the documentation folder, also don't hesitate to go through the code itself.

## Contact

If you have any questions, feedback or suggestions feel free to create a new issue here on github !
